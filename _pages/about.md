I obtained my Bachelor's and Master's degrees from Guangdong University of Technology and am currently pursuing a Ph.D. My primary research interests include signal processing, wearable healthcare, and pattern recognition. In particular, I have some experience in non-invasive blood glucose monitoring and stress detection.
